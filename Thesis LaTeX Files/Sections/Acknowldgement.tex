\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgment}
First and foremost, I would like to thank Allah for blessing me with the opportunity to pursue a bachelor's degree and for giving me good health to be able to continue.\\

I express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Ayman El-Badawy, for his constant guidance and support throughout the bachelor period. Without him, I wouldn't have been able to achieve what I did or learn what I learned. \\

I extend my thanks to my parents and sisters who always believed in me and pushed me towards being better. Without them, I wouldn't have reached where I am today.\\

Lastly, I would like to thank my colleague Zeyad Gamal, who worked on a similar topic, for his constant motivation and for sharing his insights.
